# InfiniteTableTop

An infinite canvas for your PDFs. Open as many as you like and spread them across
an endless table — drag, rotate, overlap and zoom into them exactly like sheets of
paper in front of you.

## Features

- **Infinite canvas** — pan by dragging empty space, zoom with the scroll wheel
  (or pinch on a trackpad). Zoom way out to see dozens of documents at once, or way
  in to read the fine print.
- **Open many PDFs at once** — pick multiple files or drag & drop them anywhere.
  New documents arrive arranged in a tidy grid.
- **Papers, not windows** — every PDF is a free sheet you can drag around, **rotate**
  (grab the ↻ handle below it), and **overlap** with others. Click a sheet to bring
  it to the front.
- **Adaptive detail** — pages re-render at higher resolution as you zoom in, so you
  get crisp text instead of a blurry blow-up.
- **Scales to hundreds of PDFs** — only the sheets on screen are rendered, each at a
  resolution matched to its on-screen size; off-screen sheets free their canvas. Total
  canvas memory stays around one screenful, so opening hundreds of large PDFs works
  without them turning black. Sheets appear as blank paper and fade in as they render.
- **Cached zoom** — each sheet's render is cached per zoom level (in a memory-bounded
  LRU cache), so zooming back to a level you've already viewed is instant instead of
  re-rendering.
- **Multi-page support** — flip through a document's pages right on its sheet, or
  **explode** a document into one separate, movable sheet per page (⧉ button).
- **Multi-select & groups** — hold **Shift** and drag a box around sheets, or
  Shift-click them one by one. Then delete the lot together, or **group** them.
  A group moves as one, shows a coloured ring, and can be **hidden** (it collapses
  to a chip you click to bring back), **ungrouped**, or deleted.
- **Drawing tools** — a pen, highlighter and eraser (left palette) let you annotate
  on top of and *between* the documents. Ink lives on the table, so it pans, zooms
  and stays put with everything else. Pick a colour and thickness, undo, or clear.
- **Loading progress** — opening a batch of files shows a progress bar with the
  current filename and count, so large drawings don't feel like a hang.
- **Save & reopen workspaces** — **Save** bundles everything (the PDFs themselves,
  their positions, rotations, groups, drawings and the current view) into a single
  `.ittt` file. **Open workspace** restores it exactly, even after restarting — no
  need to find the original PDFs again, because they travel inside the file.
- **Tidy & Fit** — one click to re-grid everything, another to frame the whole table.
- **Search across documents (with OCR)** — open the search panel (🔍 or **Ctrl/Cmd+F**)
  and type. Matches are found via each PDF's text layer when it has one, and via
  **OCR** ([Tesseract.js](https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/)) for scanned / image
  pages that don't. Hits are highlighted right on the sheets and you can jump between
  them with the result list or `Enter` / `Shift+Enter`. *(OCR runs on a page's rendered
  image; the English language data is fetched once on first use, so it needs a network
  connection that first time.)*
- **Choose your table surface** — a background dropdown switches between the default
  dotted grid, flat black, white, or a dark/pine **woodgrain** texture (generated on
  the fly, no image files). Your choice is remembered and saved with the workspace.
- **Get the toolbars out of the way** — hide all the chrome for a distraction-free
  view, leaving only a faint tab in the top-left corner to bring it back. Press
  **Tab** (or the − button) to toggle.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed URL (usually <http://localhost:5173>) in your browser and click
**＋ Open PDFs**.

To build a static production bundle:

```bash
npm run build      # output in dist/
npm run preview    # serve the built bundle locally
```

## How it works

Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/).
A single transformed `#world` layer provides the pan/zoom; each PDF is rendered to its
own `<canvas>` positioned in world coordinates. Rendering is virtualised — a small
manager renders only the sheets near the viewport (nearest first, a few at a time) at a
resolution matched to their on-screen size, and frees off-screen canvases — so the
canvas budget stays bounded no matter how many documents are open. Zoom snaps to
discrete resolution levels whose rendered bitmaps are kept in a memory-bounded LRU
cache, so returning to a level is an instant cache hit rather than a re-render.
Everything runs locally in your browser — your PDFs are never uploaded anywhere.

A saved workspace (`.ittt`) is just a ZIP archive: a `manifest.json` describing the
layout, groups and drawings, alongside the original PDF files (stored uncompressed,
since PDFs are already compressed). That makes a workspace fully self-contained and
portable — open it on any machine and the documents come with it.
