# InfiniteTableTop

An infinite canvas for your PDFs. Open as many as you like and spread them across
an endless table — drag, rotate, overlap and zoom into them exactly like sheets of
paper in front of you.

## Features

- **Infinite canvas** — pan by dragging empty space, zoom with the scroll wheel
  (or pinch on a trackpad). Zoom way out to see dozens of documents at once, or way
  in to read the fine print.
- **Open many PDFs at once** — pick multiple files or drag & drop them anywhere.
  New documents arrive arranged in a tidy grid.
- **Papers, not windows** — every PDF is a free sheet you can drag around, **rotate**
  (grab the ↻ handle below it), and **overlap** with others. Click a sheet to bring
  it to the front.
- **Adaptive detail** — pages re-render at higher resolution as you zoom in, so you
  get crisp text instead of a blurry blow-up.
- **Multi-page support** — flip through a document's pages right on its sheet, or
  **explode** a document into one separate, movable sheet per page (⧉ button).
- **Multi-select & groups** — hold **Shift** and drag a box around sheets, or
  Shift-click them one by one. Then delete the lot together, or **group** them.
  A group moves as one, shows a coloured ring, and can be **hidden** (it collapses
  to a chip you click to bring back), **ungrouped**, or deleted.
- **Drawing tools** — a pen, highlighter and eraser (left palette) let you annotate
  on top of and *between* the documents. Ink lives on the table, so it pans, zooms
  and stays put with everything else. Pick a colour and thickness, undo, or clear.
- **Loading progress** — opening a batch of files shows a progress bar with the
  current filename and count, so large drawings don't feel like a hang.
- **Save & reopen workspaces** — **Save** bundles everything (the PDFs themselves,
  their positions, rotations, groups, drawings and the current view) into a single
  `.ittt` file. **Open workspace** restores it exactly, even after restarting — no
  need to find the original PDFs again, because they travel inside the file.
- **Tidy & Fit** — one click to re-grid everything, another to frame the whole table.
- **Get the toolbars out of the way** — collapse all the chrome to a small pill in the
  top-left corner, or hide it entirely for a distraction-free view. Press **Tab** to
  cycle full → minimised → hidden (a faint corner tab brings it back).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed URL (usually <http://localhost:5173>) in your browser and click
**＋ Open PDFs**.

To build a static production bundle:

```bash
npm run build      # output in dist/
npm run preview    # serve the built bundle locally
```

## How it works

Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/).
A single transformed `#world` layer provides the pan/zoom; each PDF is rendered to its
own `<canvas>` positioned in world coordinates. Everything runs locally in your
browser — your PDFs are never uploaded anywhere.

A saved workspace (`.ittt`) is just a ZIP archive: a `manifest.json` describing the
layout, groups and drawings, alongside the original PDF files (stored uncompressed,
since PDFs are already compressed). That makes a workspace fully self-contained and
portable — open it on any machine and the documents come with it.
